                shadows, moving with a silence that is unnatural. He is clad in modern, grey tactical gear, a
                jarring anachronism in this ancient place. It is <span className="highlight-character">Silas</span>,

                from the ceiling, blocking the entrance you came through. For a single, terrifying nanosecond,
                the cavern walls flicker, resolving into lines of glowing green code before becoming stone again.
